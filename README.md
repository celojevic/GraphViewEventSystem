# GraphViewEventSystem (WIP)

The Graph View Event System is a custom Unity GraphView editor designed to make an in-game eventing system for game designers. Custom event graph nodes are also easy to make for your games specific purposes. A parser is included in the demo to show off the capabilities of the system. I've used something similar in a few of my projects, but I wanted to make a universal version I can easily add to any project and share it with everyone!

Note that this is currently functional, but is still a work in progress, therefore subject to breaking changes and updates. I will continue adding functionality to the graph, such as CTRL+D node duplication, and other event nodes, such as a fade in/out panel instantiater. Performance is still quite good, so optimization will be done much later (except for extremely cases).

Feel free to open issues and pull requests!

P.S. If you are good with CSS and want to design the graph with cool icons and colors, let me know!

Event system originally inspired by event systems in other game engines. GraphView basic usage inspired by Mert's node graph tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF3U0rzFKlTGzz-AUFacf9_OKiW_hGYIR) and Indie Wafflus' node-based dialogue system series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0yxB6cCkoWK38XT4stSztcLueJ_kTx5f).
