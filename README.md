# GraphViewEventSystem (WIP)

The Graph View Event System is a custom Unity editor window designed to make an in-game eventing system for game designers. Custom event graph nodes are also easy to make for your games specific purposes. A parser is included in the demo to show off the capabilities of the system. I've used something similar in a few of my projects, but I wanted to make a universal version you can easily add to your own project and share it with everyone!

Note that this is currently functional, but is still a work in progress. I will continue adding functionality to the graph, such as CTRL+D node duplication, and other event nodes, such as a fade in/out panel instantiater. Performance is still quite good, so optimization will be done much later (except for extremely cases).

Feel free to open issues and pull requests!

P.S. If you are good with CSS and want to design the graph with cool icons and colors, let me know!
